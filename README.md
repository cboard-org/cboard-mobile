# CBoard Mobile - AAC Communication Board for Mobile Devices

Cboard is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) web application, allowing users with speech and language impairments (autism, cerebral palsy) to communicate by symbols and text-to-speech.

The app uses a Flutter Text-To-Speech package to generate speech when a symbol is clicked, there are thousands of symbols from the most popular AAC symbol libraries to choose from when creating a board. Cboard is available in 40 languages, and now is available as a Flutter native mobile application (for Android and iOS).
